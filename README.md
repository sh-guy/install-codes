Install Codes
=============

Converts install codes to link keys.

This is a rewrite compatible to Python3 (the original was written in Python2).

Usage:

    $ python3 install_code.py <install_code>

Enter <install_code> without spaces. E.g. instead of 1234 5678 9012 3456 7890 1234 5678 9012 3456 enter it in the above command as 123456789012345678901234567890123456.
